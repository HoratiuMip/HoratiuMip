# Master scrolls [ `⌡≤⌠` ]
 
## WARC [ `=Z< )) O*` ]
Satellite. Satbe... or... satbe not. Are we some sort of... league of orbiters? It's right above me, isn't it? <br>
Earth images captured from the heavens, on demand, via the baddest immersive program and the sickest circuit rig (which I shall not short & burn). Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ad-astra.Made.Not-said/tree/main/IXN/Ruptures/warc).

Branched with an immersive database viewer to search the skies. Might combine them :D.

## BarrunCUDA [ `( )\/( )` ]
The "How does it hold together?" makeshift joystick controller, with only one question yet to be answered: "Does it feel better or worse than it looks?". Try not to drop the chonky battery on your toes. Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ad-astra.Made.Not-said/tree/main/Devices/BarrunCUDA). Quick demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fO5yGtDo8sk).

Pull out the tester if ain't got no gas in it. It's not a bomb, I swear... or is it? Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ad-astra.Made.Not-said/tree/main/IXN/Ruptures/BarrunCUDA-tester).

## Warp Joint Protocol [ `Σ░=█` ]
An `ISO/OSI PRESENTATION LAYER ( STACK LAYER 6 )` protocol which assures stable and reliable interpretation of both sent and received byte streams. It is a volatile wrapper around user-defined send/receive methods, providing flexible choices regarding its operation modes and procedures. Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ad-astra.Made.Not-said/blob/main/WJP/README.md).
> ![WJP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00c05698-dba6-40ca-857e-313afe16b768)

Learned tons from the first version, v2.0 is slowly baking.

## Runik-Patriot [ `\O__o/` ]
O mașină bună. Te duce dintr-una, în alta. Rage-filled, rechargable, modded lego RC truck that loves communicating: Bluetooth CLI, WJP, GSM, and perhaps GPS once I figure out how to squeeze it in there.

## IXT-NLN Engine [ `╔≤≥╗` ]
The everything-in-one penknife of software development, exposing toolsets and ready-to-go frameworks for any domains one can imagine: graphics, audio, numeric mathematics, networking, logging, image processing, memory manipulation and management, drivers, blah, blah-blah, proper name, place name, backstory stuff. It is so pretty, I like it, but I'm angry with it for some reason. Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ad-astra.Made.Not-said/tree/main/IXN).
