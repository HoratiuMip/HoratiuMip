# Master scrolls [ `⌡≤⌠` ]
 
## WARC [ `=Z< )) O*` ]
Satellite. Satbe... or... satbe not. Are we some sort of... league of orbiters? It's right above me, isn't it? <br>
Earth images captured from the heavens, on demand, via the baddest immersive program and the sickest circuit rig (which I shall not short & burn). Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ad-astra.Made.Not-said/tree/main/IXN/Ruptures/warc).

## BarrunCUDA [ `( )\/( )` ]
The "How does it hold together?" makeshift joystick controller, with only one question yet to be answered: "Does it feel better or worse than it looks?". Try not to drop the chonky battery on your toes. Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ad-astra.Made.Not-said/tree/main/Devices/BarrunCUDA).

Pull out the tester if ain't got no gas in it. It's not a bomb, I swear... or is it? Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ad-astra.Made.Not-said/tree/main/IXN/Ruptures/BarrunCUDA-tester).

## IXT-NLN Engine [ `╔≤≥╗` ]
The everything-in-one penknife of software development, exposing toolsets and ready-to-go frameworks for any domains one can imagine: graphics, audio, numeric mathematics, networking, logging, image processing, memory manipulation and management, drivers, blah, blah-blah, proper name, place name, backstory stuff. It is so pretty, I like it, but I'm angry with it for some reason. Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ad-astra.Made.Not-said/tree/main/IXN).

## Warp Joint Protocol [ `Σ░=█` ]
An `ISO/OSI PRESENTATION LAYER ( STACK LAYER 6 )` protocol which assures stable and reliable interpretation of both sent and received byte streams. It is a volatile wrapper around user-defined send/receive methods, providing flexible choices regarding its operation modes and procedures. Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ad-astra.Made.Not-said/blob/main/WJP/README.md).

## Discord Bot [ `»■«` ]
N/A yet. Detailed [here](https://github.com/HoratiuMip/Ahri).

## Feetback [ `->O->[H]->` ]
N/A yet. System control real time fondle simulator?

# Legacy scrolls [ `⌡≤⌠` ]

## Immersion engine [ `>--.--<` ]
The engine tailoring essential components of the senseful immersive programs. It was built by need, which had its roots in passion, and it blossomed back again into the latter. The set achievement is to surround everyone with the complex sensations of this world. 

### Iteration `_Zero_` [ `0` ]
The point in time when this hot mess began. Full CPU-based computing.

#### `< Console OGs >`
OG games rebuilt in the console: pac-man, snake, minesweeper, dino-run; along some other small ideas.
> ![console-og](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bf1e8a8-e29e-49f0-b1af-5f03f1df0798)

### Iteration `_Alpha_` [ `α` ]
The first iteration of the engine, a.k.a `GentleCore`. Achievement unlocked: GPU computing.

#### `< Spac-shi >`
Casual space shooter: they shoot, you shoot, but, obviously, you are OP, having energy orbs, shields, and the ability to repair your ship.
> ![spac-shi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc78e5f7-7834-484f-b7ef-4c47c3af3b51)

#### `< Graphing capabilities >`
When you need plots, you obviously make them from scratch, right?

#### `< Kill-the-player >`
[ ■■■ ___REDACTED___ ■■■ ]
> ![kill-the-player](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13036d7d-dd03-48b3-bf66-55fdcfa7ea0c)

#### `< Geo-factory >`
Destroying enemies and walking around is cool, but you need hitboxes for that. This is where this factory comes in.
![geo-factory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d2e53a3-6302-43eb-a101-648e62df6c96)

#### `< Duck >`
One may shoot as many ducks as there are stars in the universe, but one won't reach Jack Sparrow's level.
> ![duck](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/305e6217-5162-4145-99dd-c6e969a38171)

#### `< Rainbow-six >`
He asked if there was somebody playing rainbow six. Yes. There was.

### Iteration `_Bravo_` [ `ß` ]
The second iteration of the engine, a.k.a `IXT`. More in-depth use of the underlying computer system, such as `AVX` accelerated audio playback or CPU signal handlers. More smartly tied components, such as the shader cache station ( "`RenderCluster`" ). Let the results speak for itself.

#### `< WARC >`
Satellite imaging with style. And more, under the hood.
> ![warc-slick-shot-1-cut](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b275c4f-b273-4a16-b831-33a2f3529641)

#### `< BarraCUDA-CTRL Tester >`
Tester program for the `BarraCUDA` controller.

### Iteration `_Charlie_` [ `Ω` ]
The third iteration of the angine, a.k.a `IXT-NLN`. Starting off with network driver following brushing over all the `IXT`'s components, this iteration must become the first fully stable version of the engine.
