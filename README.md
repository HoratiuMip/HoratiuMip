## WARC [ `=Z< )) O*` ]
Satellite. Satbe... or... satbe not. Are we some sort of... league of orbiters? It's right above me, isn't it? <br>
Earth images captured from the heavens, on demand, via the baddest immersive program and the sickest circuit rig (which I shall not short & burn).

## Barrunah [ `( )\/( )` ]
The "How does it hold together?" makeshift joystick controller, with only one question yet to be answered: "Does it feel better or worse than it looks?". Much better actually, it still holds, and the battery is not so chonky anymore.

## AUTO-A113 Engine [ `╔≤≥╗` ]
The everything-in-one penknife of software development, exposing toolsets and ready-to-go frameworks for any domains one can imagine: graphics, audio, numeric mathematics, networking, logging, image processing, memory manipulation and management, drivers, blah, blah-blah, proper name, place name, backstory stuff. It is so pretty, I like it, but I'm angry with it for some reason.
